# Katapaty

A ruby gem for communicating with a Counterparty (Bitcoin / XCP) API server. Katapaty was inspired by counterparty_ruby.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```

And then execute:

Or install it yourself as:

Set your own counterparty node configuration in `config/initializers/katapaty.rb`

```ruby
# This is testnet counterparty node of coindaddy, you can change your own server config
Katapaty.configure do |config|
  # For counterparty APIs
  config.username = 'rpc'
  config.password = '1234'
  config.host     = 'public.coindaddy.io'
  config.port     = 14000
  # For counterblock APIs
  config.block_username = 'rpc'
  config.block_password = '1234'
  config.block_host     = 'public.coindaddy.io'
  config.block_port     = 14100
end
```
